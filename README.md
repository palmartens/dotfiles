# Dotfiles

My personal dotfiles, using dotbot. 

Compatible with: 
- Ubuntu
- Linux Mint
- Arch

So basically only debian-based Linux distro's, other debian based distro's should work too (except for some Ubuntu / Mint specific settings in the bootstrap script) 

Under construction:
- Windows (Powershell)
